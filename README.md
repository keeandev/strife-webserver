# Strife Client Webserver (2021)

A custom websocket server with packet parsing for both client and server. This server has functionality to send sound and various other packets to any active client.

I created this project to learn how the Minecraft server framework actually worked in order to build a similar system for my own purposes. This webserver was created for the use in my Minecraft client, Strife, at the time.

P.S: Old commits show hardcoded database connection strings. I can verify that those strings are not in use anymore because by now this GitHub repository is public.
